- Icon animations with spring effects
- Promise-based API for async handling
- Specialized delete confirmation dialog
- Enhanced visual feedback

**Usage:**
```tsx

const handleDelete = async () => {
  const confirmed = await showConfirmation({
    title: "Delete Item",
    description: "This action cannot be undone.",
    variant: "destructive",
    onConfirm: () => {
      // Handle deletion
    }
  })
}
```

### üì± Drawer Components (`drawer.tsx`)

Slide-out panels from any direction with drag-to-close functionality.

**Features:**
- Smooth slide transitions from all directions (top, bottom, left, right)
- Drag-to-close with physics-based interactions
- Multiple sizes and responsive design
- Drag handles for better UX
- Custom easing curves
- Backdrop blur effects

**Usage:**
```tsx
import { Drawer, DrawerContent, DrawerHeader, DrawerTitle } from "@/components/ui/drawer"

<Drawer open={isOpen} onOpenChange={setIsOpen}>

- **Exit**: Slide to right with scale and fade
- **Hover**: Subtle scale increase (1.02)
- **Stacking**: Automatic layout animations

### Modal Animations
- **Backdrop**: Fade in/out with blur effect
- **Content**: Scale with bounce easing (cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1))
- **Entrance**: Scale from 0.8 with upward motion
- **Exit**: Scale to 0.8 with downward motion

### Confirmation Dialog Animations
- **Normal**: Standard modal animations
- **Destructive**: Enhanced shake animation with scale variations
- **Icon**: Spring entrance animation with delay
- **Button**: Hover and tap effects

### Drawer Animations
- **Slide**: Direction-based entrance from edges
- **Drag**: Physics-based interactions with elastic constraints
- **Easing**: Custom smooth curve (cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1))
- **Backdrop**: Synchronized blur animations

## Performance Optimizations

- **transform-gpu**: Hardware acceleration for smoother animations
- **will-change-transform**: Optimization hint for animated elements
- **layout**: Framer Motion's layout animations for smooth repositioning
- **AnimatePresence**: Proper exit animations with mode="popLayout"

## Accessibility

- **Focus Management**: Automatic focus trapping in modals/drawers
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support
- **Screen Reader**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Motion Preferences**: Respects user's reduced motion preferences

## Customization
