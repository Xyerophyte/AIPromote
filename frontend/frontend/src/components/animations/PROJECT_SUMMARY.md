- Slide animations from different directions  
- Custom easing options (linear, easeIn, easeOut, easeInOut, backOut, bounce)
- Configurable distance and timing
- Required direction prop with 4 options

✅ **StaggerChildren** (`stagger-children.tsx`)
- Stagger animations for list items
- Automatic child element wrapping
- 6 animation types: up, down, left, right, scale, fade
- Configurable stagger timing and reverse support

✅ **AnimatedCard** (`animated-card.tsx`)
- Enhanced card with hover effects and shadows
- Multiple shadow intensities (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
- Optional glow effects with custom colors
- Spring-based animations with custom configurations
- All standard card sub-components included

✅ **GlassContainer** (`glass-container.tsx`)
- Glassmorphism container with backdrop blur
- 6 blur intensity levels (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl)
- Gradient background options
- Border and shadow customization
- Hover glow effects

### 2. Supporting Files

✅ **Export Index** (`index.ts`)
- Clean imports for all components and types
- TypeScript support with exported interfaces

✅ **Comprehensive Documentation** (`README.md`)
- Detailed component descriptions
- Full prop documentation
- Usage examples for each component
- Performance and accessibility guidelines

✅ **Practical Examples** (`USAGE_EXAMPLES.md`)
- Real-world implementation scenarios
- Landing pages, dashboards, modals, product showcases
- Loading states and integration patterns
- Performance tips and customization examples

✅ **Demo Component** (`demo.tsx`)
- Interactive showcase of all components
- Visual demonstrations of capabilities
- Complex animation combinations
- Practical implementation reference

✅ **Test Suite** (`__tests__/animations.test.tsx`)
- Unit tests for all components
- Prop validation testing
- Integration testing
- Mocked Framer Motion for testing reliability

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Used
- ✅ **Framer Motion** (v12.23.12) - Already installed
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS** (v3.4.1) - Already installed  
- ✅ **tailwindcss-animate** (v1.0.7) - Already installed
- ✅ **tw-animate-css** (v1.3.6) - Already installed

### Enhanced Tailwind Configuration
- ✅ Added custom glow shadow utilities
- ✅ Extended existing glass morphism support
- ✅ Leveraged existing animation keyframes
- ✅ Custom CSS variable support for dynamic colors

### TypeScript Support
- ✅ Fully typed components with interfaces
- ✅ Exported type definitions
- ✅ Props validation and IntelliSense support
- ✅ Generic HTML element prop inheritance

## 🎯 Key Features

### Performance Optimized
- ✅ GPU-accelerated transforms
- ✅ Intersection Observer API for viewport animations
- ✅ Configurable `once` prop to prevent re-animations
- ✅ Efficient animation cleanup via Framer Motion

### Accessibility Ready
- ✅ Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` settings
- ✅ Maintains semantic HTML structure
- ✅ Preserves focus states through animations
- ✅ Reasonable animation defaults

### Developer Friendly
- ✅ Consistent API across all components
- ✅ Extensive prop customization options
- ✅ Forward ref support
- ✅ className and style prop inheritance
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

### Design System Integration
- ✅ Follows existing UI component patterns
- ✅ Uses established Tailwind design tokens
- ✅ Consistent with existing card components
- ✅ Extensible styling approach

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Import Components
```tsx
import { 
  FadeIn, 
  SlideIn, 
  StaggerChildren, 
  AnimatedCard,
  AnimatedCardContent,
  GlassContainer 
} from "@/components/animations"
```

### Basic Usage
```tsx
<FadeIn direction="up" delay={0.2}>
  <div>Animated content</div>
</FadeIn>

<AnimatedCard hoverScale={1.05} glowEffect>
  <AnimatedCardContent>
    Interactive card with hover effects
  </AnimatedCardContent>
</AnimatedCard>
```

### View Demo
```tsx
import { AnimationDemo } from "@/components/animations/demo"

// Use in any page to see all components in action
<AnimationDemo />
```

## 🔧 Integration Notes

### With Existing Project
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing components
- ✅ Builds upon current design system
- ✅ Uses established utility classes
- ✅ Compatible with existing Framer Motion usage

### Testing
- ✅ Run tests: `npm run test animations`  
- ✅ Mock Framer Motion included for reliable testing
- ✅ Covers all component functionality
- ✅ Validates prop configurations
